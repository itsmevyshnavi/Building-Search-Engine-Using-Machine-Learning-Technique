**🚀 Building a Smart Search Engine with Machine Learning**

**🌟 Introduction**

Ever felt frustrated when search engines don't show the most relevant results? This project solves that by using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build an intelligent search engine that ranks web pages based on relevance, making searching faster and more efficient.

**🔥 Why This Search Engine?**

Unlike traditional search engines that rely on simple keyword matching, this search engine understands the context of queries and delivers highly relevant results. It:

🔹Learns from past searches to improve ranking.

🔹Uses ML models (SVM, XGBoost) for smart page ranking.

🔹Is user-friendly and efficient.
