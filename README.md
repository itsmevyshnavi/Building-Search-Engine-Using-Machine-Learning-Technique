🚀 Building a Search Engine Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project implements a search engine that uses Machine Learning techniques to provide more relevant search results compared to traditional keyword-based search engines. The system ranks web pages intelligently using PageRank and Machine Learning models (SVM, XGBoost).

🔍 Features

Intelligent Page Ranking using ML models.

Web Crawler to collect and index data.

User-friendly Interface for search queries.

Admin Panel to manage users and train ML models.

Efficient & Scalable using TF-IDF for feature extraction.
